    <h3>Linguine alle Vongole is a classic
        Italian seafood pasta made with
        fresh clams, garlic, white wine
        and lemon.
    </h3>
    <p>One of my favorite seafooddishes has got to be Linguine alle
        Vongole. The clams are sweet, salty and delicious, there's lots of fresh
        garlic, zingy lemon, white wine and fresh parsely.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>14 oz linguine</li>
        <li>2.2 lbs Vongole (clams)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 large bunch fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, rinse the clams in cold running water
            discarding any broken ones and any that remain open
            after rinsing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finely chop the garlic, add it to a large saute pan around
            gently fry the garlic for about 30-60 seconds. Next, add
            the clams and add the white wine. Cover the pan with a lid
            and give the clams a gentle shake.
        </li>
        <li>
            Keep the lid closed until the clams are all fully open.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the clams have opened, turn the heat off and add the
            cooked pasta, fresh chopped parsley and lemon. Toss
            everything together for another 1-2 minutes so the pasta
            absorbs some of the juices and serve straight away.
        </li>
    </ol>
